\doxysection{Used data structures}\label{index_intro_sec}
The two data structures i have used for this project are vector and string the string is sutable, because the members of the \doxyref{Book}{p.}{struct_book} class are mostly the names of the book , author etc... I have used the vector because like a real library you never know how big it is going to be and the time complexity of adding an element in a vector is amortised tita(1)\doxysection{Idea}\label{index_Idea}
So basically tthe idea when i was making this project was to simulate a real library.\doxysubsection{}\label{_}
In the future I would like to add annother categorization to the books -\/ genre and i would like to make a database of kind for multiple libraries ;

etc...
